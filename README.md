WebOS
=====

WebOS was developed because of the need for an easy to edit, install and administrate content management system in ColdFusion. The Company I was working for had an aging 'Legacy'-based CMS, which was at the best, difficult if not tedious to install, update and modify.   WebOS solves all of the tediousness and difficulties in running and administrating a Dynamic ColdFusion CMS.   With an easy-to-use Administration Panel, anyone with a little knowledge can use and administrate WebOS.   WebOS is a module-based CMS with a template structure used to change the site layout easily without extensive HTML knowledge.
