DESCRIPTION:
WebOS was developed through the neccessity of an easy-to-use, easy-to-edit, install and administrate Content Management Solution, written in ColdFusion.

The Company I was working for had an aging 'Legacy'-based CMS, which at it's best was bloated, and
very difficult to install, update and modify.

WebOS solves all of the tediousness and difficulties in running and administrating a Dynamic Website.

I built WebOS with a modular framework in mind, making it easy to Enhance Current Features or Add New Ones.

WebOS uses a simplified Template System so you can easily change the layout and the look of your website easily. Currently, the development project comes with 2 Templates...

With the added help of users here on riaforge, I've been able to tweak and minimize the amout of 'glitches and bugs' in my WebOS application. For those who've assisted me in this endeavor, Thank you very very much.
