To Install WEBOS, begin with creating a Datasource in your Coldfusion Admin. 
Call it what ever you like, however we recommend calling it WEBOS. Ensure that it is a Microsoft SQL Server or OBDC datasource.

Once you have completed creating your datasource, open the file:
functions/site_config.cfm

At the Very Top of the file you will see:
<!---\\ This Variable is set from the Installer //--->
<cfset datasrc = "">

Ensure that in your file these lines look similiar to:
<!---\\ This Variable is set from the Installer //--->
<cfset datasrc = "YOURDSN">

Save this file and upload it to your server.

After that has been completed, open your SQL Server Management Studio, create your database, and either import the files:
webos_tables.sql (Import this one first!!! Very Very Important)
webos_data.sql 

Or run two new queries, loading the webos_tables.sql file FIRST!

NOTE: RUN THE WEBOS_TABLES.SQL FILE FIRST. 
This file contains the table schema for webos.

Open your webbrowser and and point it to:
http://yourserver.com/
You should be seeing your Webos Installation.

You Aren't going to See much, as the site needs to be configured and modules initialized.
To do this:

To Login to the Adminsitration Section and configure your website:
http://yourserver.com/admin/
Username: admin
Password: master
